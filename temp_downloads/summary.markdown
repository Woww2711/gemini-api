This piece dives into the challenge and importance of concise writing, drawing parallels from a Scrabble game to journalism and digital communication. The author argues that while we often feel pressed for time, leading to shorter forms of communication like texts and emails, true brevity requires more effort than simply reducing word count. It's about crafting clear, impactful messages, much like boiling down a story to its essence. The author suggests that our constant digital writing often resembles a rambling, never-ending paragraph rather than a focused piece, urging a return to more deliberate and effective communication.
